# Diabetic Retinopathy

This project was developed by Mathias Gundertofte (magun15).

## The project idea

The idea of the project is to use Convolutional Neural Networks to detect signs of Diabetic Retinopathy in retina images from the kaggle competition - https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection

Each image must be classified using the following scale:

0 - No DR
1 - Mild
2 - Moderate
3 - Severe
4 - Proliferative DR


## Pre-processing

The original dataset contained 35.126 images in different sizes, shapes and colors. The image distribution is as follows:

| Class         | Name          |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 0  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

## Training

## Built With

* [TensorFlow] Backend for the Convolutional Neural Network
* [Keras] - 
* [PyCharm] - IDE
* [OpenCV] - Image
